# Fan-Powered-3D-Printed-RC-Airboat

Saw your youtube video on that RC airboat thought you could add some ribs to boat for support (print them separately) so you can still print the boat in one shell, Let me know if you have trouble opening the file im on the free license for fusion so idk how the share settings work. Included some screen shots below of what im talking about (please forgive the crudley designed boat ). Cheers
